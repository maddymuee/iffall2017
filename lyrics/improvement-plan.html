	Because my design is based on the album art for the band's EP, I was told to push this further by making the background glittery and using a closer typeface to the album. I nixed the rounded edges of the box and masked the compression on the eggs by adding a halftone filter to them in Photoshop. I was told to make the artist's name smaller so it didn't read as on the same tier of the visual hierarchy as the song title (the artist name seemed like it was part of the song title in the first pass). Finally, I made the section titles slightly smaller because they were overwhelming the lyrics.
