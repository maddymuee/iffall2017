	<h1>august 31, 2018</h1>
	<p>
		A couple days before school started, the #VisibleWomen hashtag reappeared on Twitter. Women artists posted samples of their work within the hashtag. It was inspiring to see what creative professionals, particularly illustrators, are working on.

		 I put my own work in the tag, and it ended up connecting me to a lot of illustration students my age and got my own art some attention—definitely important to note how beneficial Twitter can be to connect me to the broader art world.

		As far as interactive work goes, we spent some time in capstone researching websites on <a href="https://hoverstat.es">Hover States</a> to find examples of interesting microinteractions. I was really impressed by several.

		Jonny McLaughlin's site is interesting to me because it combines illustration, type, and interaction in a simple and fun way, pretty much exactly the kind of thing I'd like to do for my capstone. It's funny to me how established pros can get away with making such simple websites.

		Here's another—Katie Suskin. Her site is a simple interactive claymation. You can hover over the various elements on the page and they'll move. Again, very simple but super fun for the user.
