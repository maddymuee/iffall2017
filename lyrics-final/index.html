		<h3>Verse 1</h3>
		<p>
			Save your sorrows, you're wasting daylight<br />
			There's no tomorrows, we're chasing tail lights
		</p>
		<h3>Pre-Chorus</h3>
		<p>
			Say you wanna talk, wanna work it out<br />
			Well good luck, 'cause my head just touched the clouds<br />
			It's not that you are boring<br />
			It's just I'm bored of talking for tonight
		</p>
		<h3>Chorus</h3>
		<p>
			Why don't you tell me over breakfast?<br />
			'Cause I don't wanna know now<br />
			Why don't you save it for your next breath?<br />
			'Cause I don't need to know now<br />
			'Cause all we should be isn't all that we need<br />
			And I don't wanna know why
		</p>
		<h3>Verse 2</h3>
		<p>
			Your words are ringing like bells I'm tired of hearing<br />
			And I'll forget them soon as the sun has fallen
		</p>
		<h3>Pre-Chorus</h3>
		<p>
			Still you wanna talk, wanna work it out<br />
			Well good luck, 'cause my head is full of doubt<br />
			First you have to find me<br />
			I won't be putting up a fight tonight
		</p>
		<h3>Chorus</h3>
		<p>
			Why don't you tell me over breakfast?<br />
			'Cause I don't wanna know now<br />
			Why don't you save it for your next breath?<br />
			'Cause I don't need to know now<br />
			'Cause all we should be, isn't all that we need<br />
			Why don't you tell me over breakfast?<br />
			'Cause I don't wanna know now<br />
			Why don't you save it for your next breath?<br />
			'Cause I don't need to know now<br />
			'Cause all we should be, isn't all that we need<br />
			And I don't wanna know why
		</p>
		<h3>Bridge</h3>
		<p>
			Don't say, don't say it's over<br />
			Don't question me<br />
			Cause I'm not the answer<br />
			And soon you'll see<br />
		</p>
		<h3>Chorus</h3>
		<p>
			Why don't you tell me over breakfast?<br />
			'Cause I don't wanna know now<br />
			Why don't you save it for your next breath?<br />
			'Cause I don't need to know now<br />
			'Cause all we should be isn't all that we need<br />
			Why don't you tell me over breakfast?<br />
			'Cause I don't wanna know now<br />
			Why don't you save it for your next breath?<br />
			'Cause I don't need to know now<br />
			'Cause all we should be, isn't all that we need<br />
			And I don't wanna know why
