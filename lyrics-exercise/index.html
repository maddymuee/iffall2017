		If you change your mind, I'm the first in line
		<br />Honey I'm still free
		<br />Take a chance on me
		<br />If you need me, let me know, gonna be around
		<br />If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down
		<br />If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
		<br />Honey I'm still free
		<br />Take a chance on me
		<br />Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
		<br />If you put me to the test, if you let me try
	</p>
	<p>
		Take a chance on me
		<br />(That's all I ask of you honey)
		<br />Take a chance on me
	</p>
	<p>
		We can go dancing, we can go walking, as long as we're together
		<br />Listen to some music, maybe just talking, get to know you better
		<br />'Cause you know I've got
		<br />So much that I wanna do, when I dream I'm alone with you
		<br />It's magic
		<br />You want me to leave it there, afraid of a love affair
		<br />But I think you know
		<br />That I can't let go
	</p>
	<p>
		If you change your mind, I'm the first in line

		<br />If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown

		<br />Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
		<br />If you put me to the test, if you let me try

	<p>
		Take a chance on me
		<br />(Come on, give me a break will you?)
		<br />Take a chance on me
	</p>

		Oh you can take your time baby, I'm in no hurry, know I'm gonna get you
		<br />You don't wanna hurt me, baby don't worry, I ain't gonna let you
		<br />Let me tell you now
		<br />My love is strong enough to last when things are rough
		<br />It's magic
		<br />You say that I waste my time but I can't get you off my mind
		<br />No I can't let go
		<br />'Cause I love you so
	</p>
